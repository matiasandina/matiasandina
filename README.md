## Hi there 👋

I'm a Neuroscience PhD focused on experimental data pipelines and hardware–software interfaces. I build:

### Experimental data pipelines

Handling multi-day data from sensors, behavior, and imaging. Building data pipelines from raw export to analysis-ready formats. QC, metadata alignment, and improving upon vendor software limitations.  

* `uid`: [check repo](https://github.com/matiasandina/uid)

### Small tools built to unblock experiments
R and Python packages, scripts, and utilities written to resolve specific bottlenecks in data collection, processing, or visualization.
